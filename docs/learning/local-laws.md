# How local laws can add guardrails to a delta domain
Local laws on the delta network let you define custom rules that govern how your application operates and are cryptographically enforced. 

Unlike global laws that apply network-wide (like requiring valid signatures), local laws are specific to your domain and can enforce anything from KYC requirements to allowlists for exclusive access. 

Any transactions that violate your local laws will never finalize on the delta base layer, ensuring your business rules are always respected without needing to deploy complex smart contracts.

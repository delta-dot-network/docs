# Introducing delta

delta is a new distributed system that lets you launch **independent execution environments, called *domains,*** plugged into our zk-secured, global shared state machine. 

### The delta Network exists in two layers
1. **Domains:** Independent environments that handle end-user experience, transaction execution and ordering - *but not the assets themselves*.
    - Users transact within domains, which process state changes locally.
    - Domains submit State Diff Lists (SDLs) to validators to update the balance records stored there, along with proofs of minimal global laws (e.g. debit messages were signed by a valid private key, a vault did not spend more than its balance) to ensure all updates are valid.
    - Domains can optionally add proofs of additional execution (e.g. order-matching logic) or domain-specific custom local laws.

2. **Base Layer:** Validators maintaining a globally consistent state of accounts and assets. Vaults and tokens live on the base layer, and can only be affected by zk-proven, valid SDLs.
    - Validators use RISC-V proofs to independently verify SDLs for compliance with global and local laws.
    - Verified SDLs are gossiped between validators, who update the global state. Because of the spending constraints enforced in deltaâ€™s state model, all submitted SDLs can be processed by validators in parallel. Unlike legacy blockchains, delta does not produce blocks or require global total ordering.
    - Since all assets are issued and stored on a single base layer, assets on delta can be transferred and used across any domain on the network (i.e. the base layer provides native interoperability, no bridging required).

# What works well as a domain?

delta enables secure asset storage without programmability at the base layer. Use cases which can benefit greatly from delta may have some of these characteristics:

- **State-based:** balances, ownership, or tokenized objects sit at the heart of the product.
- **Internet Integration:** The product uses cloud services or external APIs. delta domains can use any existing internet infrastructure and easily wrap results in a zkâ€‘proof to use that information with delta (without requiring an oracle bridge).
- **Custom rules or logic:** The product uses logic that would be expensive, slow, or impossible to express as a smart contract on other systems. Domains can design arbitrarily complex logic in their program code or local laws, without impact to the cost of submitting state changes to delta.
- **UX-focused:** The end-users want passkey-enabled signing and seamless interoperability.

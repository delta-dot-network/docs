# What works well as a domain?

delta provides **web-native asset infrastructure** that integrates seamlessly with existing internet infrastructure. Products and applications that particularly benefit from delta typically share these characteristics:

**State-Based Assets** <br></br>
Balances, ownership records, or tokenized assets form the foundational elements of your product. delta efficiently manages these assets, offering secure, verifiable, and globally recognized asset tracking.

**Flexible Internet Integration**<br></br>
delta domains are fully compatible with modern application stacks, allowing developers to:
- Use conventional programming languages, cloud-based services, and microservices architectures to build and rapidly iterate financial products and services without the constraints imposed by traditional blockchains.
- Directly incorporate external data and APIs into workflows. delta enables easy, secure integration with external data sources (e.g., Plaid, Stripe, bank APIs) and wraps data results in cryptographic proofs, eliminating the need for complex oracle bridges.

**Customizable Business Logic and Rules**<br></br>
Implement logic and rules tailored to your unique requirements without limitations:
- Domains support arbitrarily complex business logic, rules, and conditions directly in your existing backend or local policy frameworks.
- Avoid prohibitive costs, performance bottlenecks, or complexity associated with executing such logic on conventional smart contract platforms.

**User Experience-First Approach**<br></br>
delta prioritizes intuitive, secure, and seamless user interactions:
- Enable passkey-based signing for transactions, allowing users to effortlessly confirm actions via familiar authentication methods (Face ID, fingerprint, hardware security keys), significantly enhancing security and usability.
- Continue supporting traditional blockchain wallet signing methods as needed, ensuring backwards compatibility and user choice.
- Achieve frictionless interoperability, enabling users to interact with diverse applications and platforms across the delta ecosystem without complex bridging processes or wallet management.
